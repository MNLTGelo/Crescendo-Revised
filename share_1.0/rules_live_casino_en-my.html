                              Live Super Sic Bo is a traditional game played on three dice and each dice with six faces carrying a unique value of 1 to 6 respectively. The objective of the game is to predict the outcome of the three dice after they are shaked.<br><br>

                              After the betting timer is closed, random payouts will be generated and assigned to the betting positions (refer to payout table below for the payout range). Betting positions with super payout will be displayed on the game client and all winning bets on it will be paid based on the super payout.<br><br>

                                        <p>Live Roulette uses standard European Roulette rules and is played with a live dealer and a real Roulette table.</p>

                                        <p><b>Straight Up</b><br>
                                        You can bet on any number, including 0, by placing the chip on the center of a number.</p>

                                        <p><b>Split Bet</b><br>
                                        You can bet on two numbers by placing a chip on the line that divides the two numbers.</p>

                                        <p><b>Street Bet</b><br>
                                        To bet on a row of three numbers (a street), place a chip on the boundary line of the roulette table, at the end of the corresponding row.</p>

                                        <p><b>Corner Bet</b><br>
                                        You can bet on four numbers by placing chips at the corner where the four numbers meet.</p>

                                        <p><b>Four Bet</b><br>
                                        You can bet on the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 by placing your chip on the boundary line, where the line between 0 and the first row intersects it.</p>

                                        <p><b>Line Bet</b><br>
                                        You can bet on two street bets (i.e., the six different numbers in two rows of three numbers), by placing your chip on the boundary line of the roulette table where the line dividing the two rows intersects it.</p>

                                        <p><b>Column Bet</b><br>
                                        There are three boxes labeled "2 to 1" at the bottom of each column of numbers. You can place bets for all numbers in a column by placing chip(s) in one of these boxes. If any of the numbers in the selected column is hit you get paid 2:1; 0 is a losing number.</p>

                                        <p><b>Dozen Bet</b><br>
                                        You can bet on a group of twelve numbers by placing your chip in one of the three boxes marked "1st 12," "2nd 12," or "3rd 12." If one of your 12 numbers is hit, you are paid 2:1; 0 is a losing number.</p>

                                        <p><b>Red/Black, Even/Odd, Low/High Bets</b><br>
                                        You can place a bet in one of the boxes along the long side of the table that covers half of the numbers on the roulette table (excluding 0). Each box covers 18 numbers. You win even money (1 to 1) on all of these bets; 0 is a losing number.</p>

                                        <p><b>Minimum table bet</b><br>
                                        There is a minimum table bet, meaning that all your bets added together (your total bet), must equal at least the minimum value indicated on the table (see the Min sign).</p>

                            <p>Live Super Roulette uses standard European Roulette rules with &ZeroWidthSpace;numbers 1–36 plus a single 0 (zero). During betting time players can bet on any bet types, much like the other normal roulette game.<br><br> 

                            After the betting timer is closed, there will be &ZeroWidthSpace;one to five Super Numbers (numbers between 0-36) randomly selected and highlighted. And each of the Super Number will have a random payout multiplier (the possible payouts listed below). If the winning number is one of the randomly selected Super Number/s, all Straight Up bets placed will hit the Super Payout.<br><br> 

                            <b>Super Payouts (Straight Up bets):</b><br>  
                            499:1

                            29:1<br><br> 

                            <b>Straight Up</b><br>  
                            You can bet on any number, including 0, by placing the chip on the center of a number.<br><br>

                            <b>Split Bet</b><br>   
                            You can bet on two numbers by placing a chip on the line that divides the two numbers.<br><br>

                            <b>Street Bet</b><br>   
                            To bet on a row of three numbers (a street), place a chip on the boundary line of the roulette table, at the end of the corresponding row.<br><br> 

                            <b>Corner Bet</b><br>   
                            You can bet on four numbers by placing chips at the corner where the four numbers meet.<br><br> 

                            <b>Four Bet</b><br>   
                            You can bet on the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 by placing your chip on the boundary line, where the line between 0 and the first row intersects it.<br><br>

                            <b>Line Bet</b><br>   
                            You can bet on two street bets (i.e., the six different numbers in two rows of three numbers), by placing your chip on the boundary line of the roulette table where the line dividing the two rows intersects it.<br><br> 

                            <b>Column Bet</b><br>  
                            There are three boxes labeled "2 to 1" at the bottom of each column of numbers. You can place bets for all numbers in a column by placing chip(s) in one of these boxes. If any of the numbers in the selected column is hit you get paid 2:1; 0 is a losing number.<br><br> 

                            <b>Dozen Bet</b><br>   
                            You can bet on a group of twelve numbers by placing your chip in one of the three boxes marked "1st 12," "2nd 12," or "3rd 12." If one of your 12 numbers is hit, you are paid 2:1; 0 is a losing number.<br><br>

                            <b>Red/Black, Even/Odd, Low/High Bets</b><br>   
                            You can place a bet in one of the boxes along the long side of the table that covers half of the numbers on the roulette table (excluding 0). Each box covers 18 numbers. You win even money (1 to 1) on all of these bets; 0 is a losing number.<br><br> 

                            <b>Minimum table bet</b><br>   
                            There is a minimum table bet, meaning that all your bets added together (your total bet), must equal at least the minimum value indicated on the table (see the Min sign).<br><br> 

                            <b>Voisins du zero</b><br>  
                            Is a bet on all numbers of the Voisins arc: 22, 18, 29, 7, 28, 12, 35, 3, 26, 0, 32, 15, 19, 4, 21, 2, 25. These are all the numbers on almost half the Roulette wheel, including the zero. Players need nine chips of any selected value. The chips are placed as follows: one split bet on each of the numbers 4/7, 12/15, 18/21, 19/22, 32/35, two chips on the triplet (street bet) 0-2-3 and two chips on 25-29 (corner bet).

                            <p>Blackjack is played on four Ante betting positions, four Player's Perfect Pair betting positions and one Dealer's Perfect Pair betting position.</p>
                            <p>The game allows an unlimited number of players to bet on any of the four Ante betting positions within a single game round. Multiple players may place bets on the same seat. If two players are playing on the same position, one may choose to Stand and the other may choose to Hit. In this case, the dealer will deal another card to the position, but the player who chose to Stand will not receive the card.</p>
                            <p><b>Game Rules</b></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>The objective of Blackjack is for the total of Players’ cards to be closer to 21 than the Dealer’s cards, without exceeding 21.</li>
                              <li>In Blackjack, aces count as either 1 or 11, face cards as 10, and number cards at their face value.</li>
                              <li>A combination of an ace and a ten-value for first two cards is considered a Blackjack and wins 1.5 times of Player’s original bet.</li>
                              <li>If the total value of Player’s cards is closer to 21 than the Dealer’s, wins Ante bet amount.</li>
                              <li>If the total value of cards is more than 21, Ante bets on Players consider “busted” and lose.</li>
                              <li>If both Player and Dealer have the same card total (17 to 21), neither side wins and bet is returned as “push”. Blackjack beats a score of 21.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Our Blackjack follows the standard “Las Vegas Strip” rules, with the following exceptions:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>The dealer stands on 17 (including soft 17)</li>
                              <li>Split hands cannot be split.</li>
                              <li>Only one card is drawn to split aces.</li>
                              <li>Double after splitting is allowed.</li>
                              <li>The dealer will not check for Blackjack in any case. In the event if both Player and Dealer has Blackjack, will be consider as a “push”.</li>
                              <li>Double is allowed only on first two cards combination has total value of 11.</li>
                              <li>If you double and the dealer's first card is of value 11 (ACE), and the dealer gets Blackjack, you lose both your bets. If the dealer’s first card is of value 10, and the dealer gets Blackjack, you get the Double bet back.</li>
                              <li>&nbsp;It is theoretically possible to have 8 cards dealt to you without going bust. In this case your hand automatically wins, except when the dealer has Blackjack.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Game Play:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>There is a limited time window for initial bets offering. Once an Ante bet has been placed for a betting position, the Player's Perfect Pair side bet can be placed for the same position and bets can be placed on the Dealer's Perfect Pair betting position</li>
                              <li>Initial deal will include two cards each for all betting positions with bets on it. And one faced up card for the dealer’s hand.</li>
                              <li>After which, the first betting position will start using the <b>Hit</b>, <b>Stand</b>, <b>Double</b> and <b>Insurance</b> buttons as necessary.</li>
                              <li>When choosing <b>Double</b> an additional bet amount is taken from your balance and your bet is doubled.</li>
                              <li>You must make your move in a certain amount of time. If you do not make a selection, you will automatically stand. In a split situation you will automatically fold.</li>
                              <li>If every position at the table busts (provided all online members who bet and decide to HIT which resulted in bust), the round is over. The dealer's second card will be drawn and revealed but no third or additional cards to be drawn.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Split</b><br>
                            Based on <b>Optimal Strategy Table</b>, only pair Ace and 8 combinations automatically activate a split situation. In the split situation you only have the option to <b>Split</b> or <b>Fold</b>. If you do not want to spilt and click <b>Fold</b>, Ante bets will be returned in full and you will be out of the game round. If choose to <b>Split</b>, an additional bet amount is taken from the balance and bet is doubled. An extra card will be dealt for each split card first and follow by the option to <b>Hit</b>, <b>Stand</b> or <b>Double</b> for each splitted hand.</p>
                            <p>Note:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Split aces only receive one card</li>
                              <li>Split aces combination with any&nbsp; value of 10 card will be consider as 21 point instead of Blackjack</li>
                              <li>If member doesn’t have enough balance to split, system will default action as <b>Fold</b></li>
                            </ul>

                            In a split condition, the options to <b>Hit</b>, <b>Stand</b>, <b>Fold</b> or <b>Split</b> are based on the <b>Optimal Strategy Table</b>.</p>

                            When the total value of the first two cards is 11 points, doubling is allowed. The bet amount becomes twice the original (with the difference taken out of your balance), and you are dealt one more card.<br>

                            If the dealer shows an Ace in his initial hand, you are given a chance to insure your bet against him having Blackjack. If you get Insurance, an amount equal to half your original bet is placed separately on the table. If the dealer does have Blackjack, you are paid 2 to 1 on your insurance. This way you do not lose your original bet (because you get the 2x half your original bet, plus the insurance amount back). If the dealer does not have Blackjack, you lose the insurance amount, even if you end up losing.</p>

                            <p>Traditional Fan Tan is played with white buttons, a cup and a wand. The dealer will cup some buttons, remove the cup and start dividing them in groups of 4. The number of buttons left in the last group will be 1,2,3 or 4 and this will be the game result.</p>
                            <p>“Super Fan Tan” is an adaptation which instead of white buttons, it uses the 6 cards dealt on a Live Three Pictures table as the basis for result. Each card represents a value (refer table below) and the value of all 6 cards will be added up, divide by 4 to produce the game’s winning number (1,2,3 or 4).</p>
