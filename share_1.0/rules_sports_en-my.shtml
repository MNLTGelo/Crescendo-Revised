                                            All games must start on the scheduled date (local time) for bets to have action. Abandoned or postponed matches are void unless rearranged and played on the same date (local time) or stated otherwise in the rules. An exception is made if incorrect kick off time is announced on our website. All bets on the game include overtime scoring unless stated otherwise. Games must go at least 55 minutes of play for bets to have action. If a game is suspended before 55 complete minutes are played, all bets on the outcome of the game are refunded unless otherwise stated, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined. In 2-way markets push rules apply unless otherwise stated below. Stakes on single bets are returned and in multiples/parlays the selection is treated as a non-runner. If a match venue is changed, bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed, then bets based on the original listing will be void.</p>

If a game is suspended after the minimum time has been played and not resumed the same day, then regardless of whether the game is completed at a later date, the score when the game is halted will determine the betting results.

                                            Example:<br>
                                            The final positions in golf are the following:<br>
                                            1st position: Player A<br>
                                            2nd position: Player B<br>
                                            3rd position: Player C<br>

                                            6th Position: Player F<br></p>
                                            <p>Let's say you bet on Player E (e/w ¼ 1-2-3)<br>
                                            3rd position is shared by 3 players - Player E shares 3rd position with 2 other players - so the payment will be 1/3 stake X e/w odds</p>
                                            <p>Let's say you bet on Player E (e/w ¼ 1-2-3-4)<br>
                                            Positions 3 and 4 are shared by 3 players. 3rd and 4th (not really 4th position since there are 3 players in 3rd position) positions are shared by 3 players - that means 2 positions pay, out of the 3 players who reached those positions: 2/3 stake X e/w odds.</p>

Abandoned or postponed matches are void unless rearranged and played in the same date (local time) or stated otherwise in the rules. The exception is if we advertise an incorrect start time. Should any match be played prior to the date or start time denoted then bets will stand provided the wager is placed not later than the revised start time. If a match venue is changed then bets will be void unless stated otherwise. In 2-way markets push rules apply unless otherwise stated. Stakes on single bets are returned, and in multiples/parlays the selection is treated as a non-runner. For the Olympics, following rules will apply:<br>
                                            - The podium presentation will determine the settlement of the bets.<br>
                                            - Subsequent disqualifications and/or appeals will not affect bets.
