                                                Player and a Dealer.<br><br>

                                                <b>Player</b> – Player/s ONLY compares their hand against the
                                                Dealer.<br><br>

                                                A game begins with the dealer bidding phase:<br>
                                                - Player bids for the 1, 5 or 10 consecutive rounds for the Dealer
                                                position.<br>
                                                - If nobody bids for the Dealer, a Dealer will be chosen at random.<br>
                                                - If 2 or more players bid on the Dealer position, the Dealer will be
                                                chosen at random between the bidding players.<br><br>

                                                After the dealer has been chosen, players place their bets amount, can
                                                bet x1, x2 or x3 of the table stake. Once the bet amount is confirmed,
                                                each player (including the dealer) draws up to 3 cards.<br><br>

                                                After revealing the cards, dealer hand will compare to other players
                                                hands. The last digit of the sum of 3 cards is then the value of the
                                                hand where 9 points and 3 pictures (Ex. J Q K) are the highest in hand

                                                the table or remain seated to continue playing. Players with
                                                insufficient funds would automatically be forced to leave the
                                                table.<br><br>

                                                table is given 3 domino cards from the 28 card stack. The player next to

                                                Member needs to ensure that they have sufficient balance to Buy-in
                                                before joining a table. There are 2 types of players in Super Bull game,
                                                a Player and a Dealer.<br><br>

                                                <b>Dealer</b> – The Dealer compares their hand against all players. <br>
                                                <b>Player</b> – Player/s ONLY compares their hand against the
                                                Dealer.<br><br>

                                                A game begins with the dealer bidding phase:<br><br>

                                                - Player bids for the 1 or 10 consecutive rounds for the Dealer
                                                position.<br>
                                                - If nobody bids for the Dealer, a Dealer will be chosen at random.<br>
                                                - If 2 or more players bid on the Dealer position, the Dealer will be
                                                chosen at random between the bidding players.<br><br>

                                                After the dealer has been chosen , players can then place a fixed bet
                                                amount against the dealer depending on the dealer’s total buy-in amount.
                                                Once confirmed, each player would be dealt 2 cards each.<br><br>

                                                If a player has a Pok all players would have to reveal their cards
                                                immediately and skip straight to the hand comparison phase if not
                                                players would be given the option to draw 1 more additional card or pass
                                                starting with the dealer and only after would players then compare their
                                                hands.<br><br>

                                                Once a round is completed, players would be given the option to leave
                                                the table or remain seated to continue playing. Players with
                                                insufficient funds would automatically be prompted to buy-in in-order to
                                                continue playing.<br><br>

                                                In the event of a draw game, both players and dealer will be charged
                                                half the rake for the stake placed.<br><br>

                                                <b>Card Value</b><br>
                                                Three aspects of a player's hand determine the scoring: the hand type,
                                                taem (numerical value of the overall hand, is simply the sum of the
                                                cards) and deng (the bet multiplier, determined by the relationship
                                                among the cards in hand).<br><br>

                                                <b>Card Rankings</b><br>
                                                When comparing hands player the type of hands the player has at the end
                                                of each round determines their hand ranking as well as the multiplier
                                                for their winnings. The list below displays the hand ranks in order of
                                                strongest to weakest.<br><br>

                                                total of 8 or 9. The player will automatically announce and shows this
                                                cards face-up. Pok is also considered an instant win scenario skipping

                                            <p>Before joining a room in Texas Hold’em Poker, the player would have to ensure that they have sufficient balance for the minimum Buy-in before joining a table.</p>
    
                                            <p>A round of Texas Hold’em Poker begins with a random player given the dealer chip which then have the two players to the left of the dealer place the small and big blind before the round begins. The player to the immediate left of the dealer in the small blind receives the first card and then the dealer pitches cards around the table in a clockwise motion from player to player until each has received two starting cards (Hole cards).</p>
    
                                            <p>Then players will be able to examine their cards and decide on the following options:  
                                            (pre-flop phase)</p>

                                            <p>When all the Pre-flop betting has finished, the first three community cards would be shown on the table, this is commonly known as The flop, followed by a round of betting. Until then the fourth community card will be dealt face up. This is called  The Turn, followed by another round of betting. Then the last community card is revealed, called The River, and a final betting round will be given. Once the river betting round has been completed the players now enter into the Showdown. At this point the best hand wins the pot.</p>
    
                                            <p><b>Betting Rule</b></p>

It means that at any point in the game a player can bet as much as all of the chips they have on the table, which is known as going all-in. The other players must match the amount to call the bet, or can go all-in themselves for less.</p>

                                        A typical round of Tien Len begins with each player being dealt 13 cards from a 52 card deck regardless of the total amount of players. Generally the player with the lowest value card will begin, however if there was a winner on the previous round that player will begin the round and after that the game will move in a clockwise order.<br><br>

                                        During the course of gameplay, players are able to manipulate the winning/losing stake via multipliers through various actions (Explained further below) until the first player empties their hand and then the stake of each player will be calculated based on various actions as well as “Rotten” cards in each remaining player’s hand.<br><br> 

                                        Players are given the option to Pass or Play during the game. It is not compulsory to play a card of higher value just because they own the card/s of higher value. Whenever a player plays a card and all players pass, the player will gain control of the board and is able to play any legal card combination.</p>
